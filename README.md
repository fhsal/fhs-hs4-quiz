I don't know how to store an image in this file type for readme, so the image screen shot is also in Github at : https://github.com/fhsal/hw4-quiz/blob/master/fhs-quiz-screenshot.jpg


Summary: 

The quiz page is composed of a series of elements which allow a user to start the quiz by hitting a button and then responding to questions which are displayed above a series of answer choices that they can click on.

The quiz is timed at 120 second and a countdown timer is displayed in the upper right.   If the user selects a correct answer, they will get 10 points; an incorrect answer is -5 points and a 20 second time penalty;  points and time are displayed as the quiz progresses.  

The quiz ends when either time runs out or all the questions are answered. 

Once the quiz ends, the user is presented with different buttons - they can restart the game, save their scores or clear the scores.  Saved scores are shown at the bottom of the page and persist in local storage until cleared by the user or the page is reloaded. 

There are a variety of functions and elements built in the script file to show/hide buttons, start/stop the game and timer, and save/clear scores from local storage. 

Added some additional questions - beyond the four I had been using for testing
